# Docker image for the OpeNER project

This is an update of Docker Hub [sebprunier/opener](https://hub.docker.com/r/sebprunier/opener)

## What is OpeNER ?
From the [OpeNER project website](http://www.opener-project.eu):

> OpeNER is a language analysis toolchain helping (academic) researchers and companies make sense out of "natural language analysis"

## Why a docker image ?

OpeNER needs an execution environment with a lot of requirements:

A mac / linux / unix kind of operating system
JRuby 9.1.14+
Python 2.7+
Java 1.7+
Perl 5+
libarchive development headers
Thanks to Docker, it's very easy to create such an environment, without side effects on your operating system!

## How to get the docker image ?

You can clone this repo and build the image yourself:

docker build -t opener .

Or directly get it from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/cnrilc/opener)

## How to run OpeNER ?
For example, you can start the language-identifier-server this way :

docker run -it -p 9292:9292 opener language-identifier-server

and then access the service page at http://localhost:9292
